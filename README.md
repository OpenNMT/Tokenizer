# Tokenizer

Tokenizer is a C++ implementation of OpenNMT tokenization and detokenization.

## Dependencies

* (optional) [SentencePiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece)
* (required by clients) [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) (`program_options`)

## Compiling

*CMake and a compiler that supports the C++11 standard are required to compile the project.*

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<Release or Debug> ..
make
```

It will produce the dynamic library `libOpenNMTTokenizer.so` (or `.dylib` on Mac OS, `.dll` on Windows), and the tokenization tools `cli/tokenize` and `cli/detokenize`.

### Options

* To compile only the library, use the `-DLIB_ONLY=ON` flag.

## Using

### Clients

See `--help` on the clients to discover available options and usage. They have the same interface as their Lua counterpart.

### Library

This project is also a convenient way to apply OpenNMT tokenization in existing software.

See:

* `include/onmt/Tokenizer.h` to apply OpenNMT's tokenization and detokenization

## Testing

Tests are using the [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest) framework. Once installed, simply compile the project and run:

```
test/onmt_tokenizer_test ../test/data
```
